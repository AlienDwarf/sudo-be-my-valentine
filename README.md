# sudo-be-my-valentine

A simple, interactive Valentine's Day web page where the "No" button is programmatically elusive :)

**[Demo](https://sudo-be-my-valentine.vercel.app/)**

## Functionality

This project is a lightweight single-page application with the following behaviors:

* **Evasive UI:** The "No" button randomly relocates within the viewport upon `mouseover` events, making it impossible to click.
* **Dynamic Scaling:** Every interaction with the "No" button incrementally increases the font size and padding of the "Yes" button.
* **Success State:** Clicking "Yes" triggers a confirmation screen.
